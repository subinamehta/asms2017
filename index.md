**Galaxy-P platform for multi-omics!**

#### ***Not just for genomics anymore: Galaxy for proteomics and multi-omics*** 
_Did you think that Galaxy is just for genomic data analysis? Not anymore. Come to this workshop to learn how Galaxy can be used for Mutli-omic data analysis (proteogenomic and metaproteomic) and also applications that cross the ‘omic domains. This workshop will provide attendees the opportunity to take Galaxy for a 'test drive' in analyzing MS-based proteomics data. Attendees will have the opportunity to access a Galaxy instance and a walk through of GalaxyP workflows for proteogenomic and metaproteomic data analysis. An overview of the current state of software available in Galaxy for proteomics and multi-omics applications will also be provided._ 

**Target Audience**: _Core directors, personnel, data scientists and researchers interested in proteomics, multi-omics and microbiome research. Previous experience with Galaxy or other informatics solutions is not necessary._



**_Attendees are encouraged to bring a laptop computer to participate._**

**Workshop Schedule:**
<br> _Saturday, March 25, 2017 (8:00 am - 12 noon; lunch is included from 12 noon - 1:00 pm)_
 
- Introduction to Microbiomes and metaproteomic analysis (_Pratik Jagtap_)
 
- Basics of Data Analysis and Database Search using Galaxy platform. (_Tim Griffin_)
 
- Metaproteomic analysis – Exploring taxonomy of the microbiome (_James Johnson_)
 
- Metaproteomic analysis - Exploring function of the microbiome (_Pratik Jagtap_)
 
- Summary and Conclusion. (_Tim Griffin_, _Pratik Jagtap_, and _James Johnson_)

<br>

**Workshop Goals:** 
<br>
- Introduce the Galaxy framework as a solution for data analysis across ‘omics’ domains
- Provide hands-on experience to attendees in using Galaxy
- Demonstrate use of Galaxy for a proteogenomic analysis (RNA-seq and proteomic integrative analysis)
- Lay the foundation for attendees to implement Galaxy at their own facility or institution to meet ‘omics’ data
